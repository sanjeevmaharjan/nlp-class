Are you pining for the good old days of grammar school? Perhaps you miss high
school English class and diagramming sentences, identifying subject-verb relation-
ships, and watching out for dangling modifiers. Well, you’re in luck, because part of
text analysis is recalling the basics of high school English and beyond. Kidding aside,
the next few sections build the foundation you need for the applications we’re discuss-
ing by taking a look at common issues that need to be addressed in order to analyze
text. By explicitly building this foundation, we can establish a shared vocabulary that
will make it easier to explain concepts later, as well as encourage thinking about the
features and function of language and how to harness them in an application. For
instance, when you build your QA system later in chapter 8, you’ll need the ability to
split raw strings up into individual words and then you’ll need to understand what role
each of those words plays in the sentence (part of speech) as well as how they relate to
each other via things like phrases and clauses. Given this kind of information, you’ll
then be able take in a question like “Who is Bob’s uncle?” and dissect it to know that
the question requires the answer to be a proper name (which consists of words that
have been tagged as nouns) and that it must occur in the same sentence as the words
Bob and uncle (and likely in that order). Though we take these things for granted, the
computer must be told to look for these attributes. And though some applications will
need all of these building blocks, many others will only need one or two. Some appli-
cations will explicitly state their usage, whereas others won’t. In the long run, the
more you know about how language works, the better off you’ll be in assessing the
trade-offs inherent in any text analysis system.
